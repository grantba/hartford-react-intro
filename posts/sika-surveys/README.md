# Surveys

## Daily Surveys

We send out a survey every single day. This is unconventional, but some history may help illustrate why we do it:

Once upon a time, we did surveys once a month. They were useful, but all the feedback was either about things that had just happened or about things that had happened so long ago we couldn't reasonably address them. Then we moved to bi-weekly. This was broadly better, but had the same issues. Things got a lot better when they went to weekly, but we noticed that the feedback was heavily weighted toward things that happened the previous two days, and the things that happened at the beginning of the week were largely forgotten. We found that with daily surveys, we had a tight enough feedback loop to differentiate between someone having a bad day and persistent issues with the program.

We designed the survey to be quick. If you don't have a lot to say, you should be able to finish a survey in a few seconds. If you have a lot to say, we want to give you a forum to be heard.

Additionally, while survey feedback is not necessarily private (we'll share it with people that we think will benefit from hearing it), the primary goal of survey feedback is to help make the program better. There are real people on the other end of every survey so don't be careless with your words. That said, it's expected and appropriate to talk about things that you were upset about or wish had happened differently.

## Periodic Surveys

You may also receive surveys periodically from your employer or another group. When the class is doing one of these surveys, we'll typically skip the daily survey. While daily surveys are not anonymous and are for daily personal feedback and improvement to the program, outside surveys are typically anonymous and targeted at gauging overall satisfaction.
