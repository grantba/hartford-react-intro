# Stand-Down

A stand-down is a mirror of the stand-up. It serves a couple of purposes, but the most important is that it gives everyone closure for the day and explicit permission to be done with it. All of us have great days, awful days, and lots in between. Without rituals like this, it's common to start viewing the entire experience as one long, unpunctuated slog. This is an opportunity to reflect. Furthermore, the clap at the end means that however great or awful your day was, it's over. We neither want to rest on our successes or dwell on our losses, so it's valuable to have lots of opportunities to restart.

A typical stand-down includes the following:

* **Review of survey feedback**: If there were common themes or important points to discuss from the daily feedback, we can discuss them as a group.
* **Reflection**: This is an opportunity to talk about things we learned, brag about our successes, and hold ourselves publicly accountable for things we wish we would have done differently.
* **Clap out**: This mirrors the clap from the morning. It's a way to demonstrate that you acknowledge what was shared and accept that our work together is done for the day. Stand-down claps count down from 3 to 1 (eg. "3, 2, **clap**).
