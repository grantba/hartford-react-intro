# Stand-Ups

Inspired by the [Scrum ritual](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), Sika's stand-ups are how we start our days together. A typical stand-up includes the following:

* **Morning music**: While people are signing in, we play music to help transition out of whatever headspace we were in before school to the headspace we need to be in during school.
* **Announcements**: This is a time to share any news relevant to the whole group
* **Lesson Requests**: Since our lessons are responsive to student needs, they aren't planned in advance. This is a time for all of us to talk through how we can best use our collective energy and talents to help each other learn throughout the day. This is a great time to request lessons and offer each other assistance.
* **Clap out**: Inspired by the [Football huddle ritual](https://ballarelife.com/why-do-football-players-clap-after-a-huddle/), we adjourn a stand-up by clapping. This isn't applause; it's a way to remind ourselves and each other that we are one group of people working toward one goal. For that reason, we clap one time as a group. It effectively means "Acknowledged; Let's go!". Stand-up claps count up to 3 (eg. "1, 2, **clap**").
